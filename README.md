# Venmo_Scraper
This is the tool for scraping the IRO Venmo, or really any venmo account, if you have access to the email associated with that specific venmo account

The instructions for downloading and using the code can be found in the Python_Transition_Document pdf.

The (now defunct) Bank of America account scraper is also in this github repository - if you would like to fix it feel free! The website designer that goes along with the BoFA script is in the website repo and should automatically generate webpages for you if you'd like.
